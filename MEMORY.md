# MotionMag — Running Memory

> Live state of the project. Updated at the end of each working session. The top three sections (Active milestone, Open questions, Useful snippets) are the source of truth for "where are we right now?" The session log at the bottom is the audit trail.

## Active milestone

**M0 — Scaffold + camera feed visible on screen.**

Acceptance: `npm run dev` opens a browser tab; clicking "Start" prompts for webcam permission; a `<canvas>` shows the raw webcam feed at 30fps. No magnification yet — just the pipeline up to and including capture-to-canvas.

See `PROJECT_PLAN.md` for the full milestone list.

## What's done

- Project mission, architecture, and tech stack documented in `CLAUDE.md`.
- Initial architectural decisions captured in `DECISIONS.md` (D-001 through D-010).
- Phased roadmap in `PROJECT_PLAN.md`.
- Five-star project exploration doc in `docs/five-star-projects.md`.

## What's next

1. Scaffold Vite + TypeScript project (`npm create vite@latest . -- --template vanilla-ts`).
2. Configure `tsconfig.json` for strict mode.
3. Set up minimal `index.html` with a "Start" button and a `<canvas>`.
4. Write `src/pipeline/capture.ts` with a `Camera` class wrapping `getUserMedia`.
5. Wire camera output to a 2D canvas (the WebGL pipeline comes in M1).
6. Update this file's session log with what shipped.

## Open questions

- **Q1:** Does MediaPipe Face Landmarker WASM size hurt iOS Safari first-load enough to warrant a fallback? Defer until M2 when face ROI matters.
- **Q2:** How do we handle the lighting-flicker problem (60 Hz fluorescent lights aliasing into the pulse band at 30fps capture)? Likely a notch filter at the suspected mains frequency, but we won't know until we see real-world data.
- **Q3:** Should the cog picker live in the URL hash (`#cog=pulse-finder`) so demos can be linked? Lean yes, but defer until we have 3+ cogs.

## Useful snippets

### Run the dev loop
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Webcam constraints we'll use (see D-009)
```ts
const constraints: MediaStreamConstraints = {
  video: {
    width:  { ideal: 640 },
    height: { ideal: 480 },
    frameRate: { ideal: 30, max: 30 },
    facingMode: 'user',
  },
  audio: false,
};
```

### Vite shader-as-raw-text import
```ts
import pyramidDownFrag from '../shaders/pyramid-down.frag?raw';
```

### Quick perf measurement
```ts
const t0 = performance.now();
// ...processing...
console.debug(`frame: ${(performance.now() - t0).toFixed(2)}ms`);
```

## Known dead-ends (don't try these again)

## Session log

### 2026-05-23 — Project initialized
- Created `CLAUDE.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, `MEMORY.md`, `PROJECT_PLAN.md`, `README.md`.
- Created `docs/five-star-projects.md` covering the four ★★★★★ "wait what" projects.
- Locked in tech stack: Vite + TS + WebGL2 + plain DOM. No backend, no framework.
- Locked in algorithmic approach: color-based EVM first, IIR Butterworth bandpass, 4-level Gaussian pyramid, 640×480 capture.
- Next session: scaffold Vite project and ship M0 (camera feed visible).
